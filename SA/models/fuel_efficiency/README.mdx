# Regression with OSQL NN module

Fuel prediction using regression and the Auto MPG dataset is described in 
this [Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression).
Refer to this tutorial for a walk-through of the contained ML concepts.

This model shows an example of a setup where tensorflow models are replicated with OSQL models.
The models are trained and inferred in tensorflow through SA Engine.
The model weights are read from python, and used to infer the OSQL models.

The OSQL models can be inferred on edges that dont have python.
To tranfer the weights from the machine where tensorflow training is done 
to the edge where inference with OSQL is run, they can be exported to files that are deployed with the model.

* master.osql loads everything needed to infer the models on the edge
  * inference.osql contain the models in OSQL
  * weights.osql store the weights in SQL tables and files

* usage.osql shows how to execute the training in python and transfer the weights. 
It is recommended to step through this file to learn about this model.

  * dataset.py contains functions to download the data, clean it and extract training data
  * dataset.osql contain foreign function wrappers for dataset.py

  * py_regression.py trains different examples of regression models
  * py_regression.osql contain foreign function wrappers for py_regression.py 

## Environment

This model has been tested using tensorflow 2.13.0 and numpy 1.24.3. 
It was tested on Windows, but should run on any platform with python integration and the packages above.  

There is an environment file that can be used. In this repo folder, `sa.example-models`, run the following commands:

```
cd anaconda
conda env create --file environment.yml
cd ..
conda activate sa-nn
pip install tensorflow==2.13.0
code .
```
